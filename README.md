# PimexinCodeFixer
A rename utility for CSS &amp; HTML tags/selectors...
This was a Mobitek Project for my intern. The company uses a tool called Webflow for creating static webpages and use this webpages for introducing products at online marketin websites.

So if the class names, CSS files etc. conflicts, page shows abnormalities. I developed a C# project for this purpose. User gives the html and CSS files as input. And takes the output as more clean and conflict-free pages.

All class and tags gets prefix "pimexin-"
